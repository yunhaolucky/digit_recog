BDT-SVM:
Get the average of all labelled data:

We need 9 SVM as the same as One vs All.
I calculate the gravity center of all patterns that are labelled for 10 digit classes. 
Then, the group that has the largest distance are assigned to each of the two groups. Next, compare the distance to the group and then classified all the group.
